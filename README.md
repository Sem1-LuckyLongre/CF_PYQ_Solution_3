### **Question 4:** What is called the ‘Working Memory of the CPU’ and why? Explain its types, giving the functions of each.  

**Answer:**  
The working memory of the CPU is **Cache Memory**.  

#### Types of Cache Memory:  
1. **L1 Cache:** Smallest, fastest, directly accessed by the CPU.  
2. **L2 Cache:** Larger, slightly slower, buffer between CPU and RAM.  
3. **L3 Cache:** Shared by cores, improves multi-core processing.  

#### Hinglish Explanation:  
Cache memory CPU ke processing ko fast banati hai aur frequently accessed data ko store karti hai.  

---

### **Question 5:** Which device would you recommend for the following purposes?  

1. **Processing cheques:** MICR—fast cheque data processing.  
2. **Printing designs:** Plotter—high-quality graphical output.  
3. **Selecting objects:** Touch Screen—direct user interaction.  
4. **Reading labels:** Barcode Scanner—quick product detail retrieval.  

#### Hinglish Explanation:  
Yeh devices specific purposes ke liye design kiye gaye hain jaise MICR cheques ke liye aur barcode scanner shopkeeping ke liye.  

---

### **Question 6:** Explain Cloud Computing and its advantages. Discuss the role of computers in research and education.  

**Answer:**  
#### Cloud Computing:  
Remote access to resources like servers and storage.  

#### Advantages:  
1. Cost-effective.  
2. Global accessibility.  
3. Scalable resources.  

#### Computers in Education & Research:  
1. E-learning platforms.  
2. Data analysis tools.  
3. Enhanced accessibility for researchers.  

#### Hinglish Explanation:  
Cloud computing ne data access aur sharing kaafi easy kar di hai. Research aur education mein iska role bohot important hai, especially during pandemics.

## **Second Paper: Unique Code - 62341101 (2019)**  

### **Question 1:** A user was working on a document when the computer turned off. Can the file be recovered? Discuss permanent memory features.  

**Answer:**  
The file may not be recoverable unless auto-save or backup was enabled.  

#### Permanent Memory Features:  
1. **ROM:** Non-volatile, stores firmware.  
2. **EEPROM:** Electrically erasable and programmable.  
3. **PROM:** Programmable but not erasable.  

#### Hinglish Explanation:  
Agar auto-save ya backup on nahi tha, file recover nahi hogi. ROM aur EEPROM jaise permanent memory data permanently store karte hain.  

---

### **Question 2:** Suggest an alternative to print designs. Discuss the preferred secondary storage device.  

**Answer:**  
1. **Alternative:** Plotter—for high-quality, precise outputs.  
2. **Preferred Storage:** SSD—fast, durable, and efficient.  

#### Hinglish Explanation:

### **Question 3:** Speed mismatch between processor and memory. Define Cache Hit/Miss.  

**Answer:**  
Cache solves speed mismatch by storing frequently used data.  

- **Cache Hit:** Data found in cache.  
- **Cache Miss:** Data fetched from RAM/secondary storage.  

#### Hinglish Explanation:  
Cache data access fast banata hai. Cache hit tab hota hai jab data directly cache se milta hai, aur miss tab jab data ko RAM se fetch karna padta hai.
